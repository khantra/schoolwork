<p>The Following are some of the interesting assignments we worked on in professor William Kerney's Discrete Mathematics and Data Structures class. </p>

<h3>
<a id="binary-search-tree" class="anchor" href="#binary-search-tree" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Binary Search Tree</h3>

<p>Our assignment was to create a Binary Search Tree and implement the following functions: "Insert, Search, Delete and Print".</p>

<h3>
<a id="inventory" class="anchor" href="#inventory" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inventory</h3>

<p>Our assignment was to implement different aspects of the Set Theory as a way of understanding how to work with data in a Database. Specifically we had to implement a way to read SQL like commands such as "Insert, Join, Inner Join and Select From" and then carry out the commands. </p>

<h3>
<a id="linked-list" class="anchor" href="#linked-list" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Linked List</h3>

<p>Our assignment was to create a linked list and implement the following functions: "Pop, push, search, and Remove".</p>

<h3>
<a id="merge-sort-golf" class="anchor" href="#merge-sort-golf" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Merge Sort Golf</h3>

<p>This was a submission for a class wide competition to implement a merge sort while using the least possible numbers of semicolons. I was able to do it with just "three"!</p>

<h3>
<a id="recursion-assignment" class="anchor" href="#recursion-assignment" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Recursion Assignment</h3>

<p>As a way of mastering Recursion this assignment required us to create a program that takes in a number and creates a diamond of that size. </p>

<h3>
<a id="queues-and-stacks" class="anchor" href="#queues-and-stacks" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Queues And Stacks</h3>

<p>We had to implement a queue using an array to gain an understanding of how they work.</p>
