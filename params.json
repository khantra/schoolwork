Specifically we had to implement a way to read SQL like commands such as \"Insert, Join, Inner Join and Select From\" and then carry out the commands. \r\n\r\n### Linked List\r\nOur assignment was to create a linked list and implement the following functions: \"Pop, push, search, and Remove\".\r\n\r\n### Merge Sort Golf\r\nThis was a submission for a class wide competition to implement a merge sort while using the least possible numbers of semicolons. I was able to do it with just \"three\"!\r\n### Recursion Assignment\r\nAs a way of mastering Recursion this assignment required us to create a program that takes in a number and creates a diamond of that size. \r\n\r\n### Queues And Stacks\r\nWe had to implement a queue using an array to gain an understanding of how they work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
